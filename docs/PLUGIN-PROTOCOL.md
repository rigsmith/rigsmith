# rigsmith plugin protocol

rigsmith has **one** extension mechanism, used for two kinds of plugin:

1. **Ecosystem / language adapters** (dotnet, node, go, and future cargo, python, …)
2. **Changelog generators** (default, keepachangelog, emoji, JSON-for-a-website, …)

Both are external commands invoked over a **versioned JSON-on-stdin /
result-on-stdout** contract — the same delegation model the tools already use for
`git`, `gh`, and the native package managers. This was chosen deliberately over
Go `plugin` `.so`, HashiCorp `go-plugin` (gRPC), and WASM; see the rationale in
net-changesets `docs/changelog-generator-plugins-design.md`. A plugin here is a
stateless one-shot pure function — the ideal shape for a subprocess.

## The load-bearing rule: built-ins dogfood the contract

The built-in adapters and the built-in changelog renderer are **not** a
privileged bypass. They implement the very same Go interfaces
(`plugin.Ecosystem`, `plugin.ChangelogGenerator`) that the subprocess transport
mirrors. An external plugin and a built-in are interchangeable.

Why this matters: if our own default can be driven entirely through the request
object, the contract is complete. If a golden can't be reproduced from the
request alone, the contract is missing a field — and we find out because *our own
renderer breaks*, not because a third party complains.

```
plugin.Ecosystem (interface)
├── ecosystem/dotnet  ─┐ in-process built-ins
├── ecosystem/node     │  (reference implementations)
├── ecosystem/gomod   ─┘
└── plugin.SubprocessEcosystem  ── external command over JSON

plugin.ChangelogGenerator (interface)
├── planner built-in renderer    ── in-process reference
└── plugin.SubprocessChangelogGenerator ── external command over JSON
```

## Versioning

`APIVersion` is an integer (currently `1`). The engine sends the highest version
it speaks; a plugin that doesn't recognize it must exit non-zero rather than
guess. Additive fields don't bump the version; removing/renaming/re-meaning a
field does.

## Ecosystem adapter contract

Invoked as `plugin <method>` with a JSON request on stdin and a JSON response on
stdout. Methods (see `core/plugin/protocol.go` for the exact structs):

| Method | Request | Response | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `info` | `{apiVersion}` | `EcosystemInfo{id, displayName, capabilities, manifestPatterns}` | identity + capabilities |
| `detect` | `{repoRoot}` | `{detected: bool}` | does this ecosystem apply here? |
| `discover` | `{repoRoot, sourcePath}` | `{packages: [Package]}` | enumerate releasable packages |
| `set-version` | `{package, newVersion, dependencyUpdates}` | — | stamp a version (format-preserving) |
| `publish` | `{package, packageSource, access, dryRun}` | `{published, skipped, message}` | publish via the native package manager (idempotent) |

`Package` carries `{name, displayName, version, dir, manifestPath, versionFile,
private, dependencies[]}`. `versionFile` differs from `manifestPath` when the
version is shared (a `Directory.Build.props`, a workspace-root version) — that's
what drives lockstep grouping. `dependencies[]` carry `{name, kind, range}`; an
empty `range` (e.g. .NET ProjectReference, a Go `require`) is treated as
always-out-of-range, hence the dependent is always patch-bumped.

### Discovery resolution (for the host)

A plugin command is resolved like git subcommands:
1. a built-in id (`dotnet`, `node`, `go`) → the in-process adapter;
2. a path (`./adapters/cargo`) → executed directly;
3. a bare name → `rigsmith-ecosystem-<name>` on `$PATH`.

## Changelog generator contract

Invoked once **per package being released**, `ChangelogRequest` JSON on stdin,
rendered entry **text** on stdout (the block under the package's `# Title`,
excluding the title — the engine owns file placement and insertion). See
`core/plugin/protocol.go` `ChangelogRequest` and net-changesets'
`docs/changelog-generator-plugins-design.md` for the full field reference.

Resolution: `default` → in-process built-in; a path → executed; a bare name →
`changeset-changelog-<name>` on `$PATH`.

## Status

The protocol types, subprocess host, registry, and in-process built-ins exist
and compile. What remains (PORTING-PLAN.md): route the built-in changelog
renderer through `ChangelogRequest` (the dogfooding step), and ship a reference
external plugin of each kind as a conformance test.
